The assignment in total took us around 3 days of working around 8 hours each day.

The biggest difficulty we had with thread library was properly deleting threads as to not cause
overflow errors. Before that we also had trouble with finding exceptions and having
to figure out what errors could occur. Deli overall went smoothly, except for some
output errors. The biggest difficult with deli was ensuring the program was waiting
on the correct locks and conditions. 

The only outside resources used were lecture notes for understanding thread library
and stackoverflow for general c++ questions/syntax as well as general questions about
how threads function.
